## Note

Library is currently in beta phase of 2.0.0 release. More on [RETURN_VALUE_CHANGE.md](https://github.com/Mergevos/open-vehicle-plus/blob/master/RETURN_VALUES_CHANGE.md)

## Installation

Simply install to your project:

```bash
sampctl package install Mergevos/open-vehicle-plus
```

Include in your code and begin using the library:

```pawn
#include <vehicle_plus>
```

## Usage

The library is currently, pretty well, undocumented. It tries to offers as much possibilities it could. The point is to simplify usage of vehicles' functions and try to give additional features as getting vehicle informations like respawn delay, enabled or disabled vehicle's parts, etc...
Feel free in any way to contribute.
